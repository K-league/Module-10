Mental Hurdles to Overcome:


Keeping a consistent Schedule from week to week
-Exercise 3 - 5 hrs per week
-Study 20+ hrs per week
-Decent nutrition
-Decent rest
-Getting outside for walks often (1x per day, preferably)


Prior to bootcamp starting I am thinking that I will be working in 5 hr chunks. I am strong early in the morning and I hope to play to that strength, similarly to the way I worked at University. I can be flexible and work in smaller 1.5 hr chunks, but being able to dedicate larger spans of time may be more conducive to success. I am eager to figure this out quickly, hopefully within the first 1-2 weeks. I have a clean and organized planner, which helps me to mentally prepare for coursework. I have small, handworking projects set-up to help me decompress or task switch as needed. Most importantly, I am excited about the coursework and eager to start.
